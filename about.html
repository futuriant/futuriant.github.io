            <h1>About Futuriant</h1>
            <p>
                Futuriant is a creative-tech microstudio where humans and AI meet as partners, not competitors. We build tools and present perspectives that make people better at what they do best, instead of replacing them.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that technology should extend human senses and abilities; AI should be an intelligent exoskeleton, not a box or a crutch. That's why our tools work like power-ups: boosting creativity and productivity while keeping humans in the driver's seat.
            </p>
            <p>
                From <a href="https://www.traxion.ai" target="_blank">Traxion</a>, which helps creatives rewire their mindsets and fulfill their potential, to <a href="https://www.imagineconomy.com" target="_blank">ImaginEconomy</a>, which maps out AI's impact on the creative industry, our projects all share a common goal: building bridges across the tech divide and helping people thrive in a complex world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think of what we're building as smart gear for your mind: tools that amplify your natural abilities while honoring what makes humans special: experience, judgment, creativity, and wisdom.
